A/DT SEC/NNP proposal/NN to/TO ease/VB reporting/NN requirements/NNS for/IN some/DT company/NN executives/NNS would/MD undermine/VB the/DT usefulness/NN of/IN information/NN on/IN insider/NN trades/NNS as/IN a/DT stock-picking/JJ tool/NN ,/, individual/JJ investors/NNS and/CC professional/JJ money/NN managers/NNS contend/VBP ./.
They/PRP make/VBP the/DT argument/NN in/IN letters/NNS to/IN the/DT agency/NN about/IN rule/NN changes/NNS proposed/VBD this/DT past/JJ summer/NN that/IN ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, would/MD exempt/VB many/JJ middle-management/JJ executives/NNS from/IN reporting/VBG trades/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ companies/NNS '/POS shares/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN changes/NNS also/RB would/MD allow/VB executives/NNS to/TO report/VB exercises/NNS of/IN options/NNS later/RBR and/CC less/RBR often/RB ./.
Many/JJ of/IN the/DT letters/NNS maintain/VBP that/IN investor/NN confidence/NN has/VBZ been/VBN so/RB shaken/VBN by/IN the/DT 1987/CD stock/NN market/NN crash/NN --/: and/CC the/DT markets/NNS already/RB so/RB stacked/VBN against/IN the/DT little/JJ guy/NN --/: that/IN any/DT decrease/NN in/IN information/NN on/IN insider-trading/NN patterns/NNS might/MD prompt/VB individuals/NNS to/TO get/VB out/RB of/IN stocks/NNS altogether/RB ./.
``/`` The/DT SEC/NNP has/VBZ historically/RB paid/VBN obeisance/NN to/IN the/DT ideal/NN of/IN a/DT level/JJ playing/NN field/NN ,/, ''/'' wrote/VBD Clyde/NNP S./NNP McGregor/NNP of/IN Winnetka/NNP ,/, Ill./NNP ,/, in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT 92/CD letters/NNS the/DT agency/NN has/VBZ received/VBN since/IN the/DT changes/NNS were/VBD proposed/VBN Aug./NNP 17/CD ./.
``/`` Apparently/RB the/DT commission/NN did/VBD not/RB really/RB believe/VB in/IN this/DT ideal/NN ./. ''/''
Currently/RB ,/, the/DT rules/NNS force/VBP executives/NNS ,/, directors/NNS and/CC other/JJ corporate/JJ insiders/NNS to/TO report/VB purchases/NNS and/CC sales/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ companies/NNS '/POS shares/NNS within/IN about/IN a/DT month/NN after/IN the/DT transaction/NN ./.
But/CC about/IN 25/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT insiders/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/IN SEC/NNP figures/NNS ,/, file/VBP their/PRP$ reports/NNS late/RB ./.
The/DT changes/NNS were/VBD proposed/VBN in/IN an/DT effort/NN to/TO streamline/VB federal/JJ bureaucracy/NN and/CC boost/VB compliance/NN by/IN the/DT executives/NNS ``/`` who/WP are/VBP really/RB calling/VBG the/DT shots/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Brian/NNP Lane/NNP ,/, special/JJ counsel/NN at/IN the/DT SEC/NNP 's/POS office/NN of/IN disclosure/NN policy/NN ,/, which/WDT proposed/VBD the/DT changes/NNS ./.

The/DT SEC/NNP will/MD probably/RB vote/VB on/IN the/DT proposal/NN early/RB next/JJ year/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.
Not/RB all/PDT those/DT who/WP wrote/VBD oppose/VBP the/DT changes/NNS ./.
The/DT Committee/NNP on/IN Federal/NNP Regulation/NNP of/IN Securities/NNPS for/IN the/DT American/NNP Bar/NNP Association/NNP argues/VBZ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ lengthy/JJ letter/NN to/IN the/DT SEC/NNP ,/, that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN changes/NNS ``/`` would/MD substantially/RB improve/VB the/DT {/( law/NN }/) by/IN conforming/VBG it/PRP more/RBR closely/RB to/IN contemporary/JJ business/NN realities/NNS ./. ''/''
What/WP the/DT investors/NNS who/WP oppose/VBP the/DT proposed/VBN changes/NNS object/VBP to/IN most/RBS is/VBZ the/DT effect/NN they/PRP say/VBP the/DT proposal/NN would/MD have/VB on/IN their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO spot/VB telltale/JJ ``/`` clusters/NNS ''/'' of/IN trading/NN activity/NN --/: buying/NN or/CC selling/NN by/IN more/JJR than/IN one/CD officer/NN or/CC director/NN within/IN a/DT short/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
According/VBG to/IN some/DT estimates/NNS ,/, the/DT rule/NN changes/NNS would/MD cut/VB insider/NN filings/NNS by/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT third/NN ./.
The/DT SEC/NNP 's/POS Mr./NNP Lane/NNP vehemently/RB disputed/VBD those/DT estimates/NNS ./.
The/DT rules/NNS will/MD eliminate/VB filings/NNS policy-making/VBG divisions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN sales/NNS ,/, marketing/NN ,/, finance/NN and/CC research/NN and/CC development/NN ,/, Mr./NNP Lane/NNP said/VBD ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN rules/NNS also/RB would/MD be/VB tougher/JJR on/IN the/DT insiders/NNS still/RB required/JJ to/TO file/VB reports/NNS ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ./.
